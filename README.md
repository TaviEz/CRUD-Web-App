# CRUD-Web-App
Fast And Furious' list of cars, owners etc


This is my first Web App done with asp.net. All I wanted to do was to create a web app which can create/read/update/delete some data.
I started adding data about some of the cars that are present in the "Fast And Furious" movies, writing them down in excel
and then converting them into SQL in order to be added on the website.
