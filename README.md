# CRUD-Web-App
Fast And Furious' list of cars

This is my first Web App done with asp.net using MVC. I wanted to make a web app which can create/read/update/delete data.
I added data about some of the cars that are present in the "Fast And Furious" movies, writing them down in excel and then converting them to SQL in order to be added in the query inside Visual Studio.
